# Brain Tumor Classification

<div align="justify"> 
Brain tumors pose a significant threat to human health, often leading to severe neurological damage or even fatal outcomes if not diagnosed early. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on manual analysis of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans by radiologists, a process that is time-consuming, susceptible to human error, and inefficient at scale—especially when subtle abnormalities occur in only a few image slices.
</div><br>
<div align="justify"> 
This project presents a deep learning-based approach to automated brain tumor classification, leveraging the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), InceptionV3, and Xception architectures. Each model is trained to classify MRI images into three categories: Glioma, Meningioma, and No Tumor.
</div><br>
<div align="justify"> 
To enhance model performance and reliability, the system incorporates key preprocessing steps such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction using median filters, morphological operations, and data augmentation. These steps ensure high-quality input for training and enable the models to generalize effectively across various image patterns.
</div><br>
<div align="justify"> 
The use of MRI scans, which offer high contrast and detailed visualization of soft tissues without ionizing radiation, makes this system both safe and clinically applicable. By automating tumor classification with deep learning, this project aims to support radiologists in improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing workload, and enabling faster, early detection in critical cases. </div><br>

## Model based approach to extract information about Brain Tumor from MRI scans

1. **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN) <br> CNNs are specialised neural networks that are used for image recognition and classification tasks. These networks use multiple layers with adjustable filters to process input data through convolution operations, followed by a non-linear activation function. A CNN architecture comprises convolutional, pooling, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and fully connected layers <div><br>**Convolutional Layer**: This layer extracts features from input data by applying trainable filters (kernels). The filters scan small regions of the input image and produce a feature map.</div>  The *mathematical representation* of the convolution process is: <div>G[m, n] = (f * h)[m, n] = ΣjΣk h[j, k]f[m − j, n − k] where f is the input image and h is the kernel</div> <div><br> **ReLU Layer**: ReLU is a non-linear activation function that replaces negative values in the feature map with zero, defined as f(x) = max(0, x).</div> <div><br>**Pooling Layer**: This layer reduces the dimensions of the activation map while preserving essential information. It divides the input image into non-overlapping regions and applies a down-sampling operation, such as max pooling.</div> <div><br>**Fully Connected Layer**: This layer functions as a traditional classifier, using the information generated by the previous layers to provide a final classification output. The CNN output must be flattened before being fed into the fully connected layer.</div>
<div align="center"><img src="img/1.png"></div><br>

2. **Inception V3** <br> The Inception V3 model is a deep learning framework for image classification that builds upon the original Inception V1 (GoogLeNet) model. Inception V3 comprises 42 layers and has a reduced error rate compared to earlier versions. The main enhancements in this model include breaking down convolutions into smaller components, spatial factorisation through asymmetric convolutions, the role of auxiliary classifiers, and optimised grid size reduction <div>**Factorized Convolutions**: This technique reduces the computational load by decreasing the number of parameters in the network.</div><div><br>**Asymmetric Convolutions**: A 3x3 convolution can be substituted with a 1x3 convolution followed by a 3x1 convolution.</div> <div><br>**Auxiliary Classifier**: An auxiliary classifier is a compact CNN integrated between layers during training, with its loss contributing to the overall network loss. In InceptionV3, these classifiers function primarily as regularisers.</div> <div> <br>**Grid Size Reduction**: Grid size reduction is commonly achieved through pooling operations.</div><div align="center"><img src="img/2.png"><br>

3. **Xception**<br> The Xception architecture is a CNN that extends the Inception architecture. The central innovation of Xception is the replacement of traditional convolutional layers with depthwise separable convolutions. <div>*Xception* refines the Inception approach further by decomposing convolutional layers into depthwise separable convolutions, a two-step operation that improves computational efficiency.</div> <div><br>The Xception module has three main parts: the Entry flow, the Middle flow (repeated 8 times), and the Exit flow.</div> <div> <br>The entry flow has two blocks of convolutional layers followed by a ReLU activation. The architecture includes various separable convolutional layers and max pooling layers. Skip connections are also utilised, merging two tensors using the 'ADD' operation.</div><br> <div align="center"><img src="img/3.png"></div>
